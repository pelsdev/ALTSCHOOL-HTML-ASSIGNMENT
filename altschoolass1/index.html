            I am a 400level Computer Science student at the National OPen
            University of Nigeria. Passionate about technology and innovation, I
            am currently expanding my skill set by pursuing a Frontend
            Engineering course at Alt school. With a strong foundation in
            Computer science and keen interest in modern web development, I am
            dedicated to building user-friendly, efficient and innovative
            digital solutions.

          <p>
            I applied for the Frontend Engineering course at Alt school because
            of my passion for intuitive and visually engaging digital
            experiences. As a 400level Computer science student i have a strong
            theoretical foundation in technology, but i recognized the need to
            acquire industry relevant, practical skills to excel in the fast
            evolving tech landscape. Frontend Engineering appeals to me because
            it combines creativity with problem solving, allowing me to bring
            ideas to life through responsive and user friendly web interfaces.
            Alt school's comprehensive curriculum and hands on approach align
            perfectly with my goal of becoming a skilled frontend developer.
            Beyond technical expertise, Alt school offers a vibrant learning
            community with access to mentors and peers who inspire growth and
            collaboration. This environment not only accelerates my learning but
            also prepares me to contibute meaningfully to tech industry. By
            taking this course, i aim to bridge the gap between academic
            knowledge and real-world application, paving the way for a
            fulfilling career in web development
